predecessor-falsetto
====================

This is one of the several repositories that involve the demo project to test how to do pure DDD in symfony.

This repo corresponds to all the binaries and non-code information that covers the architecture documentation and therefore does not belong to any other repo in particular.

The involved repos are:

cloakroom-dietetics
-------------------

- Application project, made with symfony.

predecessor-falsetto
--------------------

- Architecture diagrams, etc.

driveway-overshoot
------------------

- Model project, independent from symfony.

profusion-pharmacist
--------------------

- Persistence, wich can be Symfony or not.
